# Flare Loading Indicator
<img src="./example.gif" width="300" align="right">
An example of how to use a Flare controller to drive a loading animation. It waits for some condition to complete and chains a completion animation. The loading animation cycle completes after the dependent condition ensuring the completion animation plays only once the loading animation is complete.
